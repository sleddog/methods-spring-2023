    <h1>FizzBuzz in Typescript</h1>
    <h3>By Keegan Gaffney</h3>
    <p>
      Fizzbuzz is a simple programming problem where you print out every number
      up to n, with the caveat that if a number is divisible by 3 you print the
      word Fizz, by 5 you print Buzz, and by both you print FizzBuzz. My
      solution to this problem was written in Typescript.
    </p>
    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-typescript">function main(): void {
  let arg: number = parseInt(process.argv[2], 10);
  if (isNaN(arg)) {
    console.error(&quot;Please specify a number&quot;);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  for (let i = 1; i &lt;= arg; i++) {
    console.log(fizzbuzz(i));
  }
}

function fizzbuzz(n: number): string {
  if (n % 15 === 0) return &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;;
  if (n % 3 === 0) return &quot;Fizz&quot;;
  if (n % 5 === 0) return &quot;Buzz&quot;;
  return n.toString();
}

main();
</code></pre>
    <p>
      The above code is my solution to this problem. The main function simply
      checks to make sure the input is a number, then loops from 1 to that
      number. Inside this loop, the fizzbuzz function is called for each number
      in the loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fizzbuzz function is where the actual calculations come in. The most
      important part of this function is the use of the modulo or % operator.
      This operator essentially outputs the remainder if you were to divide the
      two numbers. If the output is a 0, that means the first number is
      divisible by the second number. I used this with if statements to check if
      the number is divisible by 3, 5, or 15 since 15 is divisible by both 3 and
      5. I could've probably made this faster by only having if statements for 3
      and 5 then concatenating the strings together if fizz was already part of
      the output string. The reason I didn't do this was because I felt this was
      more readable and easier to understand. The fizzbuzz function then returns
      a string to the main function to be printed.

    <h2>Run Locally</h2>
    <p>In the root of the git repository run:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">  cd fizzbuzz/typescript/Skeegan123
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Compile the TS file with the compile script (Note this requires Node, npm,
      and Typescript to be installed on your system):
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">  ./compileFizzbuzz.sh
</code></pre>
    <p>Run the program with a number passed in:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">  ./fizzbuzz.sh 10
</code></pre>
    <p>And you are done!</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This requires both Typescript and Node to be
      installed. The compileFizzbuzz.sh script checks for these dependancies and
      will exit if one is not detected with an error message telling you to
      install whichever dependancy is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Another Note:</strong> The compileFizzbuzz.sh script first checks
      for dependancies with the &quot;command&quot; command. It then runs:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">  npm i --silent
  tsc main.ts
</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Final Note:</strong> The fizzbuzz.sh script first checks if node
      is installed. Then, it checks that main.ts was compiled by looking for the
      existance of main.js. It then checks if a number was supplied as an
      argument, if not, it defaults to 25. Finally, the script then runs the
      command:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">  node main.js $num
</code></pre>
