
FIZZBUZZ Program with shell script
----------------------------------

The Python program 'fizzbuzz.py' will be ran throught the bash script 'run.sh'

The executable will take a 'max number' argument that will print out a list of numbers, incremented
by one.  Any number that is divisible by 3 and 5 will print out 'Fizz' and 'Buzz" respectively.

Preview:

Fizz

....and so on until 'max number' argument given

## Fizzbuzz++ in python
Fizzbuzz++ does the same thing as stated above, except now there is also output on numbers divisible by 7 and 11, the output being 'Ping' and 'Pong' respectively. 

Tests have also been added to test out all the functionality of the program. This can be run with 'test.sh'
