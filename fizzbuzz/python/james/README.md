#Fizzbuzz 

This program takes an integer input and prints values from 1 to the specified number. However, if the current number is divisble by 3, then the number is not printed. Rather *Fizz* is printed. Also, if the number is divisible by 5, then the number is not printed and *Buzz* is printed in its place.

##Running *Fizzbuzz.py*
	Run `run.sh {number}`, where `{number}` is your choice for the max number.
